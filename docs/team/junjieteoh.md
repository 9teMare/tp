### Project: UNite 

UNite is a **desktop app for managing contacts specifically designed for people in University**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want an easy-to-use app to manage your University contacts, UNIte is the right place to go!
